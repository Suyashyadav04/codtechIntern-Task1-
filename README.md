Library Management System
A SQL-based database project designed to manage a library's book inventory, member information,
and borrow/return transactions. This project demonstrates basic database design principles and SQL commands,
including creating tables, inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.

Features
Manage Books: Add, update, or delete book records, including title, author, genre, and available copies.
Manage Members: Keep track of members' details like name, email, and membership date.
Record Transactions: Track the borrowing and returning of books by members.
Database Schema
Tables
Books

book_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each book.
title: Title of the book.
author: Author of the book.
genre: Book genre (e.g., Fiction, Non-fiction).
published_year: Year the book was published.
copies_available: Number of copies currently available.
Members

member_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each member.
name: Member's full name.
email: Member's email (must be unique).
phone: Member's contact number.
membership_date: Date the member joined.
Transactions

transaction_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each transaction.
book_id (Foreign Key): Links to the Books table.
member_id (Foreign Key): Links to the Members table.
borrow_date: Date the book was borrowed.
return_date: Date the book was returned.
Setup Instructions
Requirements
A MySQL or PostgreSQL database server (or any SQL-compatible system).
A SQL client or tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or command-line SQL).
Steps
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
Create the database:
Open your SQL client.
Run the provided SQL script in schema.sql to create the database and tables.
Insert sample data:
Run the seed_data.sql script to populate tables with sample data.
Test the queries:
Use the SQL queries in queries.sql to perform CRUD operations and retrieve data.
SQL Features
This project demonstrates:

Create Tables: Define relational database tables with primary and foreign keys.
Insert Data: Add sample book, member, and transaction records.
Update Data: Modify existing records, such as updating book availability or member contact information.
Delete Data: Remove books or members from the system.
Retrieve Data: Query books, members, and transaction details using joins and filters.
Example Queries
Retrieve all books:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Books;
Record a book borrow transaction:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Transactions (book_id, member_id, borrow_date)
VALUES (1, 2, '2024-12-01');
Update book availability:
sql
Copy code
UPDATE Books
SET copies_available = copies_available - 1
WHERE book_id = 1;
